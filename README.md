# tasks
task manager / calendar in Rust

## Overview
I like Rust and want a simple way to manage all of my tasks, ongoing notes, and calendar events under a single roof. Thus, this. The current idea is to encode all of the tasks (tasks and calendar items) using ISO 8601 strings and a single description string. They will serialize to JSON and be manageable using an interactive terminal UI or a headless scripting interface.
## Hard Hat Required
This project is in progress. Feel free to bug me for information.
